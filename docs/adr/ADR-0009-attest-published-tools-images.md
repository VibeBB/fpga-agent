## SBOM attestations

The publisher generates an SPDX-2.3 SBOM for the digest-pinned tools image,
attests it with predicate type `https://spdx.dev/Document/v2.3`, and uploads
the artifact for 30 days. The lock stores the returned `sbom_attestation`
URL; locked-image checks verify it when present and warn when absent.
## Launcher-side verification

`FPGA_VERIFY_ATTESTATION` accepts `auto` (the default), `require`, or `off`.
Before pulling a lock-provided image, and on every `prewarm`, the launcher
uses `gh attestation verify` with the lock entry and publisher workflow.
`auto` prints one note and skips for an image override, missing attestation,
missing `gh`, or failed `gh auth status`; once verification starts, failure
or timeout prevents the pull. `require` makes skip conditions errors, while
`off` never verifies. Ordinary invocations do not re-verify a locally
present image, and `--warn` doctor paths never verify.
# ADR-0009: Attest published tools images

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The FPGA tools image is published to GHCR and pinned by digest. The digest
identifies image bytes but does not independently identify the workflow that
published them.

## Decision

The publishing workflow attaches GitHub build provenance to each published
tools image. The digest lock records the attestation URL when the image is
published. Locked-image checks verify recorded attestations against the
repository and publisher workflow; existing pins without metadata remain
usable with a warning until a new publish supplies provenance.

## Consequences

Image provenance is tied to the repository's publishing workflow without
inventing metadata for existing pins. Lock readers continue to accept the
optional attestation field.
