## Launcher-side verification

`FPGA_VERIFY_ATTESTATION` accepts `auto` (the default), `require`, or `off`.
Before pulling a lock-provided image, and on every `prewarm`, the launcher
uses `gh attestation verify` with the lock entry and publisher workflow.
`auto` prints one note and skips for an image override, missing attestation,
missing `gh`, or failed `gh auth status`; once verification starts, failure
or timeout prevents the pull. `require` makes skip conditions errors, while
`off` never verifies. Ordinary invocations do not re-verify a locally
present image, and `--warn` doctor paths never verify.

## CI runner network auditing

CI and image-publishing jobs use `step-security/harden-runner` in audit-only mode. It observes network egress without blocking requests; per-run insights are available in the GitHub Actions job summary.
